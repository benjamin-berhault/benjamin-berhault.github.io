    <p><i>To tailor the business needs of dashboards and reports production, various proprietary solutions exist.
    While these solutions are made to facilitate reports production they also limit the possibilities and may even complexify the task in some situations for people with programming background.
    Data mining teams looking for an option more flexible, efficient and open-source have nowadays a serious alternative with the Dash framework, built and maintained by Plotly.
    </i></p>
    <p><i>Dash is a productive Python framework for building web applications.</i></p>
    <p><i>Written on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, Dash is ideal for building data visualization apps with highly custom user interfaces in pure Python. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data in Python.</i></p>
    <p><i>Through a couple of simple patterns, Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols that are required to build an interactive web-based application. Dash is simple enough that you can bind a user interface around your Python code in an afternoon.</i></p>
    <p><i>Dash apps are rendered in the web browser. You can deploy your apps to servers and then share them through URLs. Since Dash apps are viewed in the web browser, Dash is inherently cross-platform and mobile ready.</i> - <a href="https://dash.plot.ly/introduction">Dash User Guide: Introduction to Dash</a></p>
