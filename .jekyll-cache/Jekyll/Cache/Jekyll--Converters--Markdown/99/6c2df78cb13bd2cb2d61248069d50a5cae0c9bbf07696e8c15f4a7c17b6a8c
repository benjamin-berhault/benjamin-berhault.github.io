    MetaTrader 5 is a free application for traders allowing to perform technical analysis and trading operations in the Forex and exchange markets. A reason why you would choose MetaTrader 5 over MetaTrader 4 is that <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/68087">the new MQL5 compiler has been optimized for the 64-bit version</a>. <br />
    <br />
    MetaTrader can be installed and run on computers with Linux using Wine. Wine is a free software that allows users of the Unix-based systems to run an application developed for the Microsoft Windows systems. Even if the documentation explains <a href="https://www.metatrader4.com/en/trading-platform/help/userguide/install_linux">how to install it on Ubuntu</a>, doing so can be a bit tricky. So, let's see how to have MeatTrader 5 64-bit operational on RHEL/CentOS 7.

<p><b>Good to know:</b> MQL5 compiler for x64 platforms claims a speed up calculations from 2 to 10 times with the new MQL5 compiler for x64 platforms.

<p>We have today only x86-64 Wine versions. However, many Windows .exe files are 32-bit and with 64-bit versions, some software have installation file in 32-bit. And other such as Office 2007, even 32-bit wine is preferred.</p>

<h4 id="one-single-script-to-build-and-install-wine">One single script to build and install Wine</h4>

<p>Check Wine download repository: <a href="http://dl.winehq.org/wine/source/">http://dl.winehq.org/wine/source/</a></p>

<p>Find in it the archive you want to use, for me: <a href="http://dl.winehq.org/wine/source/3.x/wine-3.19.tar.xz">http://dl.winehq.org/wine/source/3.x/wine-3.19.tar.xz</a></p>

<p>This url gives you the 2 parameters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ver=3.19</li>
  <li>verurlstr=3.x</li>
</ul>

<p>The whole process has already been written as a shell script by <a href="https://www.systutorials.com/239913/install-32-bit-wine-1-8-centos-7/">Eric Z Ma</a>, I just perfomed some slight modifications to it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, erase old wine versions installed.
    <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo yum erase wine wine-*
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Download this script: <a href="http://localhost:4000/scripts/install-wine-i686-centos7.sh">install-wine-i686-centos7.sh</a>.</li>
  <li>Give execute permission to it
    <pre><code class="language-bash">chmod +x ./install-wine-i686-centos7.sh
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>And execute it
    <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo ./install-wine-i686-centos7.sh 3.19 3.x
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="step-by-step-process">Step by step process</h4>

<p>Erase old wine versions installed</p>

<p>If you ever installed wine packages, erase them first as we will build wine from the source.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">yum erase wine wine-*
</code></pre>

<p>Install packages needed to build wine</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">yum install samba-winbind-clients -y
yum groupinstall 'Development Tools' -y
yum install libjpeg-turbo-devel libtiff-devel freetype-devel -y
yum install glibc-devel.{i686,x86_64} libgcc.{i686,x86_64} libX11-devel.{i686,x86_64} freetype-devel.{i686,x86_64} gnutls-devel.{i686,x86_64} libxml2-devel.{i686,x86_64} libjpeg-turbo-devel.{i686,x86_64} libpng-devel.{i686,x86_64} libXrender-devel.{i686,x86_64} alsa-lib-devel.{i686,x86_64} -y 

# ... and more ...
# Check the `install-wine-i686-centos7.sh` script for more packages needed.
</code></pre>

<p>Download and unpack the source package</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">ver=3.19 # We will use this as the example. 
verurlstr=3.x

vermajor=$(echo ${ver} | cut -d'.' -f1)

cd /usr/src
if [[ "${vermajor}" == "1" ]]; then
  wget http://dl.winehq.org/wine/source/${verurlstr}/wine-${ver}.tar.bz2 -O wine-${ver}.tar.bz2
  tar xjf wine-${ver}.tar.bz2
else
  wget http://dl.winehq.org/wine/source/${verurlstr}/wine-${ver}.tar.xz -O wine-${ver}.tar.xz
  tar xf wine-${ver}.tar.xz
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Build wine 32-bit and 64-bit versions</p>

<p>Make directories for building wine 32-bit and 64-bit versions.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">cd wine-${ver}/
mkdir -p wine32 wine64
</code></pre>

<p>Build the 64-bit version first as 32-bit version building depends on it.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">cd wine64
../configure --enable-win64
make -j 4
</code></pre>

<p>Build the 32-bit version now.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">cd ../wine32
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/pkgconfig ../configure --with-wine64=../wine64
make -j 4
</code></pre>

<p>Install wine 32-bit and 64-bit versions</p>

<p>Now, we can install Wine. The trick is to install 32-bit version first and then the 64-bit version.</p>

<p>As we are still in the win32 directory, run</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">make install
</code></pre>

<p>Install the 64-bit version:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">cd ../wine64
make install
</code></pre>

<p>By now, if everything goes well, you have successfully installed the Wine 32-bit and 64-bit versions. You may double-check it with the file command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ file `which wine`
/usr/local/bin/wine: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=a83b9f0916e6c0d5427e2c38a172c93bd8023d98, not stripped
$ file `which wine64`
/usr/local/bin/wine64: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=4d8e8468402bc63bd2a72c59c57fcad332235d41, not stripped
</code></pre>

<p>Note the “ELF 32-bit” and “ELF 64-bit” in the file type strings.</p>

<p>Now you can run either 32-bit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">wine my_app.exe
</code></pre>

<p>or 64-bit</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">wine64 my_app.exe
</code></pre>

<h4 id="problem">Problem</h4>

<p>After downloading the MT5 setup file designed for Windows with Wine on Linux and after running it, you suddenly stumble upon this little problem related to some proxy information no one knows.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"> Specify the Proxy Server
</code></pre>

<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>

<p>So the solution is simple you just need to install MT5 under a computer with Windows then just look for MT4 files under Program Files and import them on your Linux computer :</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install MT5 on a Windows machine</li>
  <li>Zip MT5 files under Program Files</li>
  <li>Extract your zipped MT5 files on your Linux machine</li>
  <li>Run MT5 with Wine
      <ol>
        <li>for MetaTrader:
          <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">wine64 terminal64.exe</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>for MetaEditor :
           <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">wine64 metaeditor64.exe</code></pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Specify the information of your broker</li>

</ol>
