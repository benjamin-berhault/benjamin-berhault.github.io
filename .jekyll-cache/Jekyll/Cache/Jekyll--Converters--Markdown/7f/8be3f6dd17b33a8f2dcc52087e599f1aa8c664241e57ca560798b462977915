    MetaTrader 5 is a free application for traders allowing to perform technical analysis and trading operations in the Forex and exchange markets. A reason why you would choose MetaTrader 5 over MetaTrader 4 is that <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/68087">the new MQL5 compiler has been optimized for the 64-bit version</a>. <br />
    <br />
    MetaTrader can be installed and run on computers with Linux using Wine. Wine is a free software that allows users of the Unix-based systems to run an application developed for the Microsoft Windows systems. Even if the documentation explains <a href="https://www.metatrader4.com/en/trading-platform/help/userguide/install_linux">how to install it on Ubuntu</a>, doing so can be a bit tricky. So, let's see how to have MeatTrader 5 64-bit operational on RHEL/CentOS 7.
