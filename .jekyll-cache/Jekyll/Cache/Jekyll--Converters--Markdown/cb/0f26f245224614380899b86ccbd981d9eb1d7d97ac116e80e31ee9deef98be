<p>How to install Tex Live on CentOS 7 Linux?
By Eric Z Ma | In QA | Updated on Aug 18, 2018</p>

<p>The LaTex packages in CentOS 7 Linux is not sufficient enough. I would like to Install Tex Live such as Tex Live 2016. How could I install it on CentOS 7?</p>

<p>The best way I found is to use the texlive offical installation tool to install the full packages for texlive 2016. It will take around 4.5GB.</p>

<p>First, remove existing texlive packages if they are installed:</p>

<h1 id="yum-erase-texlive-texlive">yum erase texlive texlive*</h1>

<p>Then download installation package from its website.</p>

<p>And execute the installation tools in the decompressed package:</p>

<h1 id="sudo-install-tl">sudo ./install-tl</h1>

<p>It will download and install the packages/tools for texlive.</p>

<p>You will need to install the <code>Digest::MD5</code> perl module by</p>

<p>yum install perl-Digest-MD5 -y</p>

<p>if it is not installed yet.</p>

<p>After it is done, set the path in your ~/.bashrc or a global location accordingly:</p>

<p>export PATH=/opt/texlive/2016/bin/x86_64-linux/:$PATH</p>

<p>Here, /opt/texlive/ is the path you chose to install texlive. If you choose another location, you can replace it with the one you used.</p>
